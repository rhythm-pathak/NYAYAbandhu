					This Bill proposes cashless treatment for victims in the ‘golden hour’ (time period up to one hour following a traumatic injury during which likelihood of preventing deaths through prompt medical care is the highest). It also aims to codify the law on Good Samaritans, provided the assistance they provide is in good faith, voluntarily and without expectation of reward.

The compensation for death in hit and run cases is proposed to be increased to Rs 2 Lakh.

It recognises offences committed by juveniles and holds the guardian of the juvenile or the owner of the vehicle liable unless it is proved that the offence was committed without their knowledge.

									The Rajya Sabha on Wednesday passed the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016, a vital reform that will make it much easier to do business in India.
									The bill proposes the creation of a new class of insolvency professionals that will specialize in helping sick companies. It also provides for creation of information utilities that will collate all information about debtors to prevent serial defaulters from misusing the system. The bill proposes to set up the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India to act as a regulator of these utilities and professionals.

It also proposes to use the existing infrastructure of National Company Law tribunals and debt recovery tribunals to address corporate insolvency and individual insolvency, respectively.
